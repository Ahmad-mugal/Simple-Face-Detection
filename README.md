# Simple-Face-Detection
This repository contains a simple face detection model using the OpenCV library. OpenCV is a powerful open-source computer vision library that provides tools for image and video analysis. This model allows you to detect faces in images and video streams, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, including security, video surveillance, and augmented reality.
##Customize the Model
The face detection model used in this repository is a simple example. You can customize it by modifying the parameters in the face_detection.py script or by replacing the model with a more advanced pre-trained model from OpenCV.

##License
This project is open-source and is available under the MIT License. Feel free to use and modify it for your own projects.

Enjoy face detection with OpenCV! If you have any questions or encounter issues, please open an issue in this repository.
